# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a course/lecture template using Claude Code + Beamer + Zotero with RAG-based literature search.
Each lecture is a standalone Beamer presentation with an accompanying Jupyter notebook.

## Build Commands

```bash
make slides                              # Compile all slides into lectures/output/main.pdf
make clean                               # Clean build artifacts
uv run pytest tests/ -v                  # Test all exercise notebooks with solutions
uv run python scripts/syncing/main.py    # Run Zotero sync daemon
uv run python scripts/tools/rag.py "query"  # Search literature with RAG
```

## Architecture

### Lecture Structure
- `lectures/main.tex` - Top-level LaTeX file that `\input`s all chapter slides into one PDF
- `lectures/output/main.pdf` - Compiled output (single PDF with all chapters + speaker notes)
- `lectures/XX_name/notes.md` - User's draft notes (source of truth, `--` = new slide, `s:` = speaker notes)
- `lectures/XX_name/slides.tex` - Chapter slides (no `\documentclass`, included by main.tex)
- `lectures/XX_name/figures/` - Extracted figures for this chapter
- `lectures/XX_name/exercises/YY_name/{notebook.ipynb, utils.py}` - Exercises
- `lectures/XX_name/claude_notes.md` - AI's research notes (only when explicitly instructed)

### Figure Extraction
The sync pipeline auto-extracts figures and tables from paper PDFs using Docling into `bib/{key}/figures/`. Each figure gets:
- `fig0.png`, `fig1.png`, ... (pictures)
- `table0.png`, `table1.png`, ... (tables)
- `fig0_caption.txt`, `table0_caption.txt`, ... (captions, when available)

When slides need a figure from a paper, use the ones in `bib/{key}/figures/`. Inspect the numbered files to find the right one.

Do NOT use manual page cropping or PyMuPDF `get_images()` — those produce bad results.

### Presenter Mode
Use `dspdfviewer` to present with speaker notes on Mac:
```bash
brew install dspdfviewer
dspdfviewer lectures/output/main.pdf
```
This splits the Beamer dual-screen PDF automatically (slides on projector, notes on laptop).

### Shared LaTeX Config
- `lib/preamble.tex` - Shared preamble included by all lectures
- `lib/packages.tex` - Beamer package imports
- `lib/settings.tex` - Beamer theme and formatting
- `lib/metadata.tex` - Course metadata (`\coursetitle`, `\instructor`, `\institution`)

### Bibliography System
- `bib/refs.bib` - BibTeX file auto-synced from Zotero
- `bib/labels.bib` - Extracted LaTeX labels for autocomplete
- `bib/[citation_key]/` - Per-paper folders containing fulltext, chapters, metadata

### Sync Pipeline (`scripts/syncing/main.py`)
Runs continuously (30s interval) via nohup in the background. Check if it's running with `pgrep -f syncing/main.py`. If not running, start it with:
```bash
nohup uv run python scripts/syncing/main.py > /dev/null 2>&1 &
```

### Experiments
- `experiments/` - Cloned experiment repositories (git-ignored)

### Configuration
`scripts/config.yaml` controls Zotero sync, text extraction, chapter splitting, and embeddings settings.

## Exercise System

### File structure

Each exercise lives in `lectures/XX_name/exercises/YY_name/` with two files:
- `notebook.ipynb` — the notebook students open (single source of truth)
- `utils.py` — test/check functions (print PASS/FAIL)

### Notebook cell pattern

Per exercise within a notebook, cells appear in this order:
1. **Markdown** — explanation + instructions
2. **Code cell** — skeleton with `# TODO`. Cell metadata must include `"exercise_id": "some_id"`
3. **Test cell** — calls check function from `utils.py` (e.g. `test_tangent(tangent)`)
4. **Hint/Solution markdown** — collapsible `<details>` blocks with the full standalone solution in a ` ```python ``` ` block. Cell metadata must include `"solution_id": "some_id"` matching the exercise

The solution code block must be a complete, standalone replacement for the exercise cell (full function/class definition, not just the body).

The notebook also needs at the top:
1. **Colab badge** as first markdown cell (REQUIRED)
2. **Setup cell** — fetches `utils.py` from GitHub raw URL on Colab, uses importlib reload

### Testing

`tests/test_notebooks.py` auto-discovers every `notebook.ipynb` under `lectures/*/exercises/*/`. For each one it:
1. Finds all cells with `exercise_id` metadata and all cells with `solution_id` metadata
2. Extracts the python code from each solution cell's ` ```python ``` ` block
3. Asserts every exercise has a matching solution
4. Swaps the solution code into the exercise cell
5. Executes the entire notebook
6. Fails if any cell errors or any output contains "FAIL"

No separate solutions file needed. The notebook is the single source of truth.

Run with: `uv run pytest tests/ -v`

### Adding a new exercise

1. Create `lectures/XX_name/exercises/YY_name/`
2. Author `notebook.ipynb` directly in Jupyter/Colab following the cell pattern above
3. Write `utils.py` with test functions that print PASS/FAIL
4. Tag exercise code cells with `exercise_id` and solution markdown cells with `solution_id` in cell metadata
5. Run `make update-links` to fix Colab badge and raw GitHub URLs
6. Verify: `uv run pytest tests/ -v` should pick it up automatically

## Key Rules

1. **Never modify `_fulltext.md` files** - Read-only source material
2. **Only write `slides.tex` when explicitly asked** - User writes notes, AI transforms to Beamer frames
3. **Put each sentence on a new line** in LaTeX files (improves diffs, invisible in PDF)
4. **Read existing slides before editing** to maintain context and consistency
5. **Verify citations** by reading the corresponding `bib/[key]/[key]_fulltext.md`
6. **Search literature** when answering questions about papers or verifying claims
7. **Notes are the source of truth** - slides should never contain information not in notes
8. **Never manually edit `bib/refs.bib`** - Auto-synced from Zotero. Use the Zotero skill to add papers.
9. **Avoid em-dashes (---)** - Use commas, parentheses, or separate sentences instead
10. **Use `[fragile]`** on frames with verbatim or code content
11. **Use `[allowframebreaks]`** on bibliography frames
12. **Keep frames concise** - Bullet points, not paragraphs
13. **New lectures**: Copy an existing lecture folder, update the title and Colab badge URL
14. **Notebooks must have the Colab badge** as the first markdown cell
15. **Shared metadata** lives in `lib/metadata.tex` - update there, not per-lecture
16. **Exercises are the main value prop** - Participants can read slides on their own
